            As you probably know, Microsoft has rebranded, enhanced and
            transitioned Dynamics NAV to Dynamics 365 Business Central. If your
            business is interested in implementing an ERP system with all the
            features of Dynamics NAV, plus the newest emerging technologies,
            weâ€™re excited to offer Dynamics 365 Business Central, on-premises or
            in the cloud. Dynamics 365 Business Central includes all the core
            functionality of Dynamics NAV, along with new technology innovations
            such as artificial intelligence, IoT, machine learning, automations,
            and real-time data streaming. Tighter integrations with other
            Microsoft business applications make it easier to connect your
            functionality, analyze information, streamline workflows, and unify
            your business. Additionally, regular upgrades for Business Central
            are automatic, saving you the time and hassle of requiring IT
            support just to update your system.
